# GitHub Action: Lint Python

## Purpose

This repository is GitHub action to lint python tailored to my personal preferences.

## Features

Tools used

- [black](https://github.com/psf/black) - *Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting.*
- [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) - *pycodestyle is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8.*
- [flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) - *flake8 is a python tool that glues together pep8, pyflakes, mccabe, and third-party plugins to check the style and quality of some python code.*
- [Pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/) - *Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.*
- [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) - *isort is a Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections and by type.*
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) - *Mypy is an optional static type checker for Python. You can add type hints (PEP 484) to your Python programs, and use mypy to type check them statically.*

Options

- Planned options to turn on/off tools used
- Planned options to parse additional arguments such as line length or ignore certain rules
- Options should be mapped to all tools used
- Option to format or to check

## Requirements
